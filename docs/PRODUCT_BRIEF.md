# Real Estate Data Scraping Backend - Product Brief

## Project Overview
Development of a robust backend system for a Chrome extension that aggregates real estate data from major housing and apartment websites including Redfin, Apartments.com, and Zillow. The backend serves as the data foundation for an existing analytics and frontend infrastructure, focusing exclusively on data acquisition, processing, and modeling capabilities.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Real estate professionals, investors, and market analysts seeking comprehensive property data
- **Secondary**: Home buyers and renters requiring aggregated market insights
- **Technical**: Existing Chrome extension users with established frontend/analytics workflows

## Primary Benefits / Features
- **Multi-source Data Aggregation**: Unified data collection from major real estate platforms (Redfin, Apartments.com, Zillow)
- **Real-time Scraping Engine**: Automated data extraction with configurable scheduling and rate limiting
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Standardization, deduplication, and enrichment of raw property data
- **Structured Data Models**: Consistent schema for properties, pricing, location, and market metrics
- **API Integration**: Clean REST/GraphQL endpoints for frontend consumption
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Validation, error handling, and data integrity monitoring

## High-level Tech/Architecture
- **Scraping Framework**: Python-based (BeautifulSoup) with proxy rotation and anti-detection measures
- **Data Processing**: ETL pipeline with pandas for transformation and scheduling
- **Database**: Locally hosted PostgreSQL for structured property data storage with indexing for fast queries
- **API Layer**: FastAPI/Flask for RESTful endpoints with authentication and rate limiting
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized deployment (Docker)
- **Monitoring**: Logging and alerting systems for scraping health and data quality metrics

The backend integrates seamlessly with the existing Chrome extension frontend and analytics components, providing reliable, structured real estate data at scale.
